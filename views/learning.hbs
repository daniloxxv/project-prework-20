    What is Distributed Version Control?

  </h1>
  <cite class= "sublead">
    A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) is a system that records changes to a  set of files over time so you can recall specific versions later.

  <p data-section-id="1" class="commentable-section">
    <strong>In software development, distributed version control (also known as distributed revision control) is a form of version control where the complete codebase - including its full history - is mirrored on every developer's computer.</strong> This allows branching and merging to be managed automatically, increases speeds of most operations (except for pushing and pulling), improves the ability to work offline, and does not rely on a single location for backups.
  </p>
  <p data-section-id="2" class="commentable-section">
   Distributed revision control systems (DVCS) takes a peer-to-peer approach to version control, as opposed to the client–server approach of centralized systems. Distributed revision control synchronizes repositories by exchanging patches from peer to peer. <strong>There is no single central version of the codebase; instead, each user has a working copy and the full change history.</strong>

  <p data-section-id="3" class="commentable-section">
    The distributed model is generally better suited for large projects with partly independent developers, such as the Linux kernel project, because developers can work independently and submit their changes for merge (or rejection). The distributed model flexibly allows adopting custom source code contribution workflows. <strong>The integrator workflow is the most widely used.</strong> In the centralized model, developers must serialize their work, to avoid problems with different versions.

    <strong>GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git.</strong> It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
